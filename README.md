# Python-Projects

This is where I post all my personal python projects and also post an executable version of it. Feel free to comment on what should I make!
I mostly know how to GUI-based python stuff! That's a lot easier. Btw, here is the official Github webpage to get started with gui based python projects: https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui
I use that python package, because it's easy to understand and learn.

To install this package, just do a simple:
```
pip install dearpygui
or
pip3 install dearpygui
```
